# Project Overview:
In a world where human interaction is increasingly mediated through digital channels, the true depth of our emotions can sometimes be lost in translation. The "EmoVoice" project aims to bridge this gap by developing an innovative Speech Emotion Classification system that can accurately decipher and classify human emotions from english language. Imagine a world where machines can not only understand what we say but also how we feel, allowing for more empathetic and meaningful interactions.


## Installation and Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. I give the necessary information about the software requirement.

- General Purpose: General purpose packages like `os, pickle, zipfile, IPython, warnings, tqdm`
- Data Manupulation: Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `numpy, pandas`
- Data Visualization: Include Packages like `matplotlib, seaborn`
- Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `tensorflow, sklearn, librosa, keras`
- Deployment: Package used to create web app `streamlit`


### Data Acquisition

Here is the kaggle dataset URL:-
In this project I used only RAVDESS, TESS datasets. you can try different.

## Future work

- Enhanced Emotion Accuracy: 
Currently I am getting 58-61% val_accuracy so to plan is continuously refining the emotion classification models by collecting more diverse and extensive datasets to capture cultural, linguistic, and individual variations in emotions. Exploring advanced neural network architectures and ensembling techniques could also improve accuracy.
